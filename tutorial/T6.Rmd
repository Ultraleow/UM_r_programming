## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
attitude
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(attitude)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1.	See basic descriptive statistics

Run the function and observe the output, paste your output here.

a)	What is the difference between (attitude[3]) and (attitude$learning)

```{r}
summary(attitude[3])
```


```{r}
summary(attitude$learning)
```

```{r}
attitude[3]-attitude$learning
```


2.	Lists name of variables in a dataset
```{r}
colnames(attitude)
```

3.	Calculate number of rows in a dataset
```{r}
nrow(attitude)
```

4.	Calculate number of columns in a dataset
```{r}
ncol(attitude)
```

5.	List structure of a dataset
```{r}
structure(attitude)
```
```{r}
typeof(attitude)
```
6.	See first 6 rows (by default) of dataset
```{r}
head(attitude)
```
7.	See first n rows of dataset
```{r}
n<-15
head(attitude,n)
```
8.	See all rows but the last row
```{r}
head(attitude,nrow(attitude)-1)
```
9.	See last 6 rows (by default) of a dataset
```{r}
tail(attitude)
```
10.	See last n rows of dataset
Select to see the last 12 rows of dataset.
```{r}
tail(attitude,12)
```
11.	See the last n rows but the first row
```{r}
tail(attitude,nrow(attitude)-1)
```

12.	Number of missing values
Which function will returns number of missing values in each variable of a dataset?
```{r}
colSums(is.na(attitude))
```
13.	Number of missing values in a single variable
```{r}
colSums(is.na(attitude[3]))
```
14.	Plot a simple graph, which will appear on a screen device.
```{r}
plot(attitude$learning)
```

15.	Plot the graph shown below, and make it appear on a file device (a pdf file)
```{r}
pdf(file="figure.pdf")

plot(attitude$privileges,attitude$learning, xlab="Privileges",
   ylab="Learning",main="Learning Attitude",xlim=c(30,80))

```
